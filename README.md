# Green Health Monitor – Real-Time Environmental Public Health Alert System

## Problem Statement
Environmental factors such as air pollution, extreme heat, and poor wind circulation have a direct and serious impact on public health.  
Existing weather and air-quality apps mainly **display raw data**, but they often fail to:
- Detect sudden hazardous events in real time
- Correlate multiple environmental factors together
- Explain *what the data actually means* for human health

This creates a gap between **data availability** and **actionable public health awareness**.
